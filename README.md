# Code-Quiz

## Description

This project was created to create a quiz game about JavaScript. The aims of this are to practice my current knowledge in JavaScript and to create a quiz that meets the following criteria:

* A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
* Questions contain buttons for each answer.
* When answer is clicked, the next question appears
* If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock
* The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.
* When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score

The main things I've learned from this project are:

* The use of setInterval and setTimeout functions.
* Better utilise the map function for arrays.
* A better understanding of Objects and how to access data within them.

## Installation

For this project, the developer tool I'll be using is VS Code. A lightweight IDE that allows working in JavaScript. It also allows the use of Extensions which can add extra functionality to the tool to help with debugging and making code more readable. The main extension I'll be using is called, Live Server, by Ritwick Dey. The browser that the web page will be used on is Google Chrome and will work on all Chromium-based web browsers.

## Usage

The game can be displayed which each stage of the game show in the GIF below:

Scores are saved on the browsers local storage so the player would need to delete them manually using the developer tool or by clearing cache.
